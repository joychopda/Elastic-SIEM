# Elastic - SIEM
üîç Elastic SIEM: Centralized Log Collection & Security Monitoring

This project showcases the setup and configuration of the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to create a centralized, real-time Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Implemented on a Kali Linux VM, the goal was to collect, analyze, and visualize logs for enhanced threat detection and incident response.

üöÄ Project Goals

 ‚úÖ Centralize log collection from multiple endpoints

 ‚úÖ Visualize and analyze logs using Kibana dashboards
 
 ‚úÖ Simulate attack scenarios and validate detection
 
 ‚úÖ Set up alerts for suspicious activity

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Overview

1. Elastic Stack Installation
	‚Ä¢	Deployed Elasticsearch and Kibana on a Kali Linux VM
	‚Ä¢	Configured Elasticsearch for indexing and storage
	‚Ä¢	Used Kibana for UI-based log search and visualization

2. Elastic Agent Deployment
	‚Ä¢	Installed and configured Elastic Agent on endpoints
	‚Ä¢	Enabled modules to capture system logs, network activity, and security events
	‚Ä¢	Resolved connectivity and firewall issues to ensure seamless data flow

‚öôÔ∏è Activity Simulation & Analysis

To generate realistic logs:
	‚Ä¢	Ran: nmap -p- localhost
Simulated a full port scan to trigger alerts and validate log ingestion

In Kibana:
	‚Ä¢	Queried logs using KQL, e.g., process.args: "<process_name>"
 	‚Ä¢	Filtered events and monitored specific behaviors

üìä Custom Filters & Log Management
	‚Ä¢	Created custom filters for improved log categorization
	‚Ä¢	Optimized indices and enabled log rotation to manage data volume
	‚Ä¢	Filters accessible via: Security > Rules in Kibana

üì© Alerting Mechanism

Configured email alerts for:
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized access attempts
	‚Ä¢	Anomalous network traffic patterns
	‚Ä¢	High CPU or memory usage

‚úÖ Outcome

This Elastic SIEM project resulted in:
	‚Ä¢	A functional and scalable centralized logging setup
	‚Ä¢	Real-time visibility into system and network activity
	‚Ä¢	Practical experience with Elastic Stack components
	‚Ä¢	Sharpened skills in incident detection, analysis, and response
